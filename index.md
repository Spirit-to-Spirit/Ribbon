# Ribbon

## Prologue

The *laboratory* is a small narrow room, barely two shoulders wide. Jammed against three walls, a table sits. A chair is pushed in. One has to close the door to pull the chair out. Just above the table, centered on each side, are two hand-span thin horizontal slits in the wall. From these slits flow two ribbons. One from each side, they almost meet in the center of the table.

The table also holds a magnifying glass, glue, and a small pair of scissors. What would one do?

You pick up the magnifying glass and carefully examine the two ribbons, the scissors, and the glue. You wish you could examine the magnifying glass with itself, but *c'est la vie*.

Gluing the ribbon seems like the clearest purpose for this setup. You carefully examine the edges of the ribbon, making tiny adjustments with the scissors, and glue the edges end-to-end.

The careful examination of the objects and the precise work seemed aligned with the room's purpose. But a question lingered: *Do you know anything about the ribbon outside of this room, or the consequence of its gluing?*

## Commentary

We respond to circumstances in reasonable and learnt ways. Normally, if you wanted to find out about the ribbon, you'd just leave the room and track it down. But what if the room is *all* you know and can access?

The leap from *all* you know, to *all* there *is*, seems common, even seductive. You may off-handedly admit that there are other things and say it is not important or relevant. You *know* what the world is like.

## Disquiet

The uncertainty grows slowly, but it grows. Your attention now turns to the slits. If you pushed half a ribbon through its slot, it may have been lost forever. If you pulled and found an end, you may be able to push it back through. Gluing may not have been a bad call.

You start tugging on the right side. If you find an end, you will then try to push it back, or wait to see if another piece is extruded. You watch the growing pile of folds on the table with interest as you tug. You suddenly feel tension in the ribbon. The left side is disappearing through the slit. You have a loop!

## Commentary

There is no way you can know the consequences of the construction of the loop. This is a simple physical system, where you have imperfect knowledge. Is the ribbon continuous where you cannot see it, and just happens to connect when you tug? Does it have twists? Is it vibrating?

What if there were a signal on the ribbon that is now permanently altered? What if that signal is coupled to other signals in other ribbons you do not see?

Now imagine that *glue* is a trajectory of nerve impulses from stimulus to integration to response. A ribbon in itself with an activated signal. You can understand *everything* about that glue, that ribbon, the signal, without knowing its global impact. So before we decry structural and functional perspective, we have to make sure we are out of our little room.
